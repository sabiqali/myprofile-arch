    This course is to show what benefits current and future quantum technologies can provide to machine learning, 
    focusing on algorithms that are challenging with classical digital computers. We put a strong emphasis on implementing 
    the protocols, using open source frameworks in Python. Prominent researchers in the field will give guest lectures to 
    provide extra depth to each major topic. These guest lecturers include Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Seth Lloyd, Roger Melko, and 
    Maria Schuld.

    This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. 
    Topics include: 
      
    - _Supervised learning_ - parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks 

    - _Unsupervised learning_ - clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning 

    - _Best practices in machine learning_ - bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI 
    

    The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning 
    algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision,
    medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

    This course teaches you learn how to train and run machine learning models in any browser using TensorFlow.js. 
    You’ll learn techniques for handling data in the browser, and at the end you’ll build a computer vision project that 
    recognizes and classifies objects from a webcam.<br><br>
    I personally incorporated my learning in this course into my internship at Myelin Foundry to test viability of project 
    deployment in Tensorflow.js for web browser based inference. This was done for multiple projects.

    This course teaches you how to use a suite of tools in TensorFlow to more effectively leverage data and train your model. 
    You’ll learn how to leverage built-in datasets with just a few lines of code, use APIs to control how you split your data, 
    and process all types of unstructured data. <br><br>
