      This one-week, accelerated online class equips students to containerize workloads in Docker containers, deploy them to
      Kubernetes clusters provided by Google Kubernetes Engine, and scale those workloads to handle increased traffic.  
      Students also learn how to continuously deploy new code in a Kubernetes cluster to provide application updates.
